# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Vision
To be the most accessible and practical guide for beginners and intermediate learners to get started with physical AI and humanoid robotics, empowering them to build and experiment with their own robotic systems.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
Every concept must be accompanied by practical, step-by-step projects and code examples that readers can build themselves. Theory exists to support practice, not replace it.

### II. Beginner-Friendly
All content must be written with the assumption that the reader is new to the topic. Concepts should be explained clearly, avoiding unnecessary jargon, and building from simple to complex.

### III. Practicality and Real-World Relevance
Focus on skills and projects that are applicable to real-world robotics challenges. Prioritize common platforms and open-source tools.

### IV. Modular and Extensible Content
The book and its documentation should be structured in a modular way, allowing readers to jump into topics of interest and easily extend the projects.

## Success Criteria
- High reader engagement measured by community contributions, questions, and project showcases.
- Positive reviews highlighting the book's practical approach and clarity.
- The Docusaurus site is consistently ranked as a top resource for the covered topics.

## Constraints
- **Tech Stack**: All documentation and supplementary materials must be built and maintained using Docusaurus.
- **Scope**: The content must stay focused on the beginner to intermediate level. Advanced, research-level topics are out of scope.
- **Hardware**: Projects should rely on accessible and affordable hardware platforms.

## Stakeholders
- **Readers**: Beginners and intermediate learners in robotics and AI.
- **Authors & Contributors**: The primary writers and community members who contribute content.
- **Educators**: Teachers and professors who may use this book as course material.

## Brand Voice
- **Tone**: Encouraging, clear, and authoritative yet approachable.
- **Style**: Direct and concise. Use visuals, diagrams, and code snippets extensively.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, community approval, and a clear migration plan for existing content. All contributions must verify compliance with these principles.
